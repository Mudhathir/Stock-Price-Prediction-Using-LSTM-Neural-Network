# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Network

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The dataset consists of synthetic stock data for the year 2024.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage the power of LSTM neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for time series prediction due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is synthetic stock data for the year 2024. The data includes the following columns:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow


##Usage


1.Generate the Dataset: Use the CSV to generate the synthetic stock data for 2024

2. Run the LSTM Model



The Results of the LSTM Model are visualized by plotting the actual stock prices and the model's predictions for both the training and testing datasets.
